# Cache'em all - A Social URL Shortener
##### ü•á Winner @ UofT Newhacks

This Google Chrome extension transforms long URLs into memorable sequences of Pok√©mon images. Share your sequences with friends across the room or across the world for easy access, even if they don't have the extension installed.

## Overview

When you activate Cache'em all, you are tasked to select with replacement any mix of 9 Pok√©mon you'd like your URL to map to. Once you're satisfied, clicking `Generate` makes a one-time request to retrieve the currently active tab in your browser, which along with your Pok√©mon are directed to our database for bookkeeping.
- Each choice is represented in our system as a single character, and we provide visual feedback of this format to service those who maybe haven't touched their Nintendo DS in a while. All the Pok√©mon we curated start with different letters of the alphabet to prevent any confusion (and collisions for that matter)!
- We technically cap sequences and URLs at 255 characters. This actually means, given an adequate amount of persistent users, there are 1+9+81+729+‚ãØ+9<sup>255</sup> = (9<sup>256</sup>-1)/8 valid possibilities of sequences that can be represented in our system ([Proof](http://mikestoolbox.com/powersum.html)). We don't intend for anyone to exceed 7 at a time, but leave that choice up to the individual.

## Why Pok√©mon though?

The inspiration for this project comes from a feature in the global phenomenon that was Pok√©mon GO. Battling powerful foes, in limited-time battles coined as raids, required help from physically nearby players. All one had to do to invite others to their raid group was communicate an ordered triplet of popular Pok√©mon.![Raid queue](pogo.jpg) Our idea was to emulate this experience to make our Internet consumption fun and convenient, whilst honing our skills in system design.

## Implementation
